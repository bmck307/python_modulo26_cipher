# python_modulo26_cipher
This is a cipher that converts upper or lower case numbers to base 26 with 1 being representive of 'A' and 'a.' To solve, all one must do is take the numbers that are output and perform modulo 26. 

Limitations:
This cipher does not work on any character other than spaces and letters.
